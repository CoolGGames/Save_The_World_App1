    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>Why is it important to protect the environment?</h3>
    <div class=part1>
    <p>The environment is directly linked to human health. Polluted air, water, and soil can lead to a range of health problems, including respiratory diseases, cancer, and neurological disorders.</p>

<p>The environment is also home to a vast array of species, all of which play a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance. The loss of biodiversity can have far-reaching consequences for the planet, including food scarcity, the spread of disease, and the breakdown of ecosystems.</p>
<p>Additionally, the environment is closely tied to climate change. Human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet's temperature to rise. This can lead to sea-level rise, more frequent and severe natural disasters, and other catastrophic effects.</p>
<p>Finally, protecting the environment is essential for sustainable development. We need to ensure that future generations can meet their needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This requires a shift towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly way of living.</p>
